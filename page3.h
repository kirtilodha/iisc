    <h1>You're in danger.</h1>
    <h3>Follow the steps to reduce water pollution.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>DO NOT pour fat from cooking or any other type of fat, oil, or grease down the sink. Keep a “fat jar” under the sink to collect the fat and discard in the solid waste when full.</li>
      <li>Avoid using a garbage disposal. Keep solid wastes solid. Make a compost pile from vegetable scraps.</li>
      <li>Install a water efficient toilet. In the meantime, put a brick or 1/2 gal container in the standard toilet tank to reduce water use per flush.</li>
      <li>Use the minimum amount of detergent and/or bleach when you are washing clothes or dishes. Use only phosphate free soaps and detergents.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Follow the steps to protect yourself from poor water quality.</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Boiling- This is a reliable way to purify water.</li>
      <li>Use Ultraviolet Light
This looks similar to a small flashlight. You just swish it around in the water for a few minutes and the bacteria can already be killed. This is very easy to carry with you and so easy to use. </li>
      <li>Use of Iodine solution, tablets or crystals- This is an effective and more convenient method. It is also available in different forms you will surely find one that would suit your budget. It has the ability to kill viruses and bacteria. They are lightweight and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Use chlorine drops-
Chlorine has the ability to kill bacteria in water. It is also lightweight, affordable, and easily accessible.</li>
<li>Use water filter- Water filters can remove bacteria in water. Carbon on the other hand gets rid of the chemicals and awful tastes while iodine coated screens can further remove viruses. Treated water can be consumed after the treatment and the water has no bad taste. </li>
      </ul>
